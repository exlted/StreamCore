# StreamCore
StreamCore is a system to unify as many streaming platforms into a single, selfhosted utility as possible. At this time the plans primarily include the platforms that I personally utilize in my streaming setup, but providing more platforms should be easy once the base systems are built.

The intention is to replace all basic capabilities of systems like StreamLabs and StreamElements, providing chat and alert overlays for your stream. Along with that, this will include cross-platform bot and chat relay capabilities if you're using multiple platforms.
